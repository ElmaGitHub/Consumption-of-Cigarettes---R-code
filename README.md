# Consumption-of-Cigarettes---R-code
For this Project, we will use the Cigarette data set in the Ecdat package

This project analyses and interprets the consumption of cigarettes in the USA between 1985 and 1995.

state: the two letter abbreviation for the state.
year: the year.
cpi: consumer price index for the year.
pop: state population
packpc: average number of packs of cigarettes per capita per year
income: total state personal income.
tax: average state, federal, and average local excise taxes for fiscal year.
avgprs: average price per pack during fiscal year, including sales taxes, in cents.
taxs: average excise taxes per pack for fiscal year, including sales taxes, in cents.


Which states have the highest number of packs? Which have the lowest?
What can you say about cigarette usage in these years?
Are the price and the per capita packs positively correlated, negatively correlated, or uncorrelated?
Does the relationship between the two variable change over time?
adjust the price of a pack of cigarettes for inflation by dividing the avgprs variable by the cpi variable.
the number of packs per capita in 1995 was significantly different than the number of packs per capita in 1985?
